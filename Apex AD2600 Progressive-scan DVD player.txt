i/p button[+2]##im a more happier person after discovering the input button ! 

dvd player[+2]##but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! 
 
player[+2],sound[-1]##i have had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor . 
price[+2]##for the price it is a well spent investment ! 


look[+3],panel button layout[+3],feature[+2]##it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . 
forward[+2], rewind[+2]##its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
video format[+3]##it plays alternate video formats very well . 
price[+3]##and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? 

play[+2], dvd-r[+1]##what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . 


audio output[+2]##another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 

forward[+2]##at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! 

remote control[-1], mp3 filename[-1]##weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . 

finish[+2]##update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 
 
play[-2], disney movie[-2]##many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . 

dual-layer dvd[-2]##player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . 

player[+1], look[+3]##player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 
player[-3]##i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . 
apex[-3]##will never purchase apex again . 
customer service[-3], technical support[-3]##customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . 

case[+2]##for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 
dvd[-2], read[-2], play[-2]##then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . 
cd[-2]##new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . 
player[-3]##i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . 

player[-3]##this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 
 
customer service[-2]##no way to contact their customer service . 
quality[-3]##very bad quality . 

player[+2]##i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . 
player[+1]##i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . 

player[+2][p]##have used it frequently and have had no problems . 

player[+2][p]##i liked this one enough to buy another . 
apex[+2]##my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . 
picture quality[+2],feature[+2]##great quality picture and features . 
 
player[-2][p]##they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them . 
 
player[-1]##nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . 

player[-2][u]##this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . 
door[-2]##the door would not close . 
customer service[-3]##i tried to contact apex to return it and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . 

look[+2], feature[+2]##it looks great - and is loaded with features . 
player[-2][p]##unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type . 
player[-2][u]##have had problems since the first day 
play[-2], dvd[-2]##- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . 

apex[+2]##the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
player[+1][p]##i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . 

smell[-2]##it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time . 
freezing[-1]##the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . " 

player[+2]##he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . 
jpeg slideshow[+2],mpeg1[+1]##the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
remote[-1]##the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . 
button[-2]##i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 

zoom mode[-2]##i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 
zoom[-2]##the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . 
onscreen display[-2]##having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . 

player[+2][p]##while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it . 
[t] do not buy this piece of junk . 

picture[-2], player[-3][p]##it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do . 

player[-2]##i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . 
customer service[-3]##i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 

play[-2], disc[-2]##won't play a lot of discs . 

play[-2]##some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today . 
play[-2]##it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten . 
tech support[-3]##tech support from apex is literally nonexistent . 

player[-3][u]##i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
dvd player[-3]##it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 
 
dvd player[-2]##the dvd player does not work properly . 
player[-3]##the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . 
player[-2][p]##this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . 
customer support[-3]##after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . 

player[+2][p]##nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . 
play[-2], dvd[-2]##unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 

dvd[-2]##on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd . 

player[-2]##unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything . 
 
work[+2]##we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . 
jpeg[+2]##even viewed cds full of jpgs . 
 
picture[-2], player[-2][p]##but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . 

apex[-3]##i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . 

player[-3][p]##who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . 

remote[-2]##we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked . 

dvd[-2], play[-2]##( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! 
. 
remote[-2]##i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective . 
 
customer service[-3]##the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . 
apex[-3]##i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
. 
door[-2]##door broke after a month . 
unit[-3]##unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 
player[-2][p]##3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . 

player[+1]##well , it was nice while it lasted . 
player[-2]##after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . 
player[-3][u]##as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . 


picture[-2]##it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . 
color[-2]##the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 

unit[-2][u]##the entire unit was poorly crafted . 
screw tip[-2]##there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
dvd[-2], play[-2]##after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it . 

player[-2]##the dvd player just would't recognize them . 
no disc[-2]##it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc . 

format[+2][u],progressive scan[+2]##this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature . 

player[-3]##i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 


feature[+2]##because of it 's hidden features i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's . 

play[+2], different file[+2]##the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's . 
play[+2], mpeg[+2]##it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . 

play[+2][p]##i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great . 
feature[+2]##for the money apex machines have good features . 

design[+2]##it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice . 
player[+2][u]##i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . 

player[-3][p]##now i know why - they are pieces of junk . 
no disc[-2], screen[-3][u]##less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . " 

service[-3]##same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . 
 
format[+2]##i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . 
aff[+2]##the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 
design[+2]##loved the slim design . 

color signal[-2]##this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 
customer service[-2]##apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy . 


audio[+2]##audio is excellent . 

player[+3], format[+2]##i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . 
 
player[+2][p]##but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . 

player[+2][u]##simple to use and hook up . 

progressive scan[+2],remote[+3]##the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . 
  
play[-3][p]##it wo n't play all of my movies . 

player[-3][p]##mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs . 

player[-2][p]##each of the 4 lasted less than six months . 

player[+3]##this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . 

player[+3]##this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong . 

play[-2], dvd[-2], no disc[-2]##i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . 


dvd player[+2]##well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! 
media[+2][u]##it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 
user interface[+2]##i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds . 

player[+2]##i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . 

look[+2][u],panel[+2]##and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! 
remote control[-2]##one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . 
shipping[+2]##finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! 
[t] poor quality dvd player . 
player[-3]##i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad . 
player[-3]##the first one would n't work from the start . 
player[-2]##the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! 
##amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com ! 
##i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one . 
on-line support[-3][u]##i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy . 
##i will never buy another apex digital product ! 
[t] you get what you paid for . 
player[+1]##for the most part this is a good dvd player . 
dvd[-2], picture[-2], play[-2]##but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments . 
##usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it . 
##annoying . 
[t] no picture and / or no sound , try i/p button on the remote . 
product[-3][u]##we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working . 
##it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs . 
picture[-2], sound[-2]##there was neither picture nor sound . 
##connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture . 
##the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help . 
##i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control . 
##it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode . 
##obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode . 
product[+2]##we are overall pleased with product . 
manual[-1]##i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 
[t] people with video issue 's . 
##i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan . 
##another stupid move . 
[t] buyer beware . 
##i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 . 
picture[-3]##it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . ) 
support[-3]##i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . 
##i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one ! 
support[-3]##neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . ) 
##i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info . 
##let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) : 
##" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again . 
[t] barely worked . 
dvd[-2], read[-2], no disc[-2]##it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . 
##i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back . 
##amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ). 
[t] has problems reading some dvds. 
##good : 
progressive scan player[+2],price[+2]##progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) . 
dvd[+2],sound[+2]##seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . 
read[+2], svcd[+2], vbr mp3 cd[+2]##also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) . 
output[+3]##output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv . 
##bad : 
disc[-1], recognize[-2]##i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) . 
no disc[-2]##it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " . 
remote[-3]##my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . 
##for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button . 
button[-3]##you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . 
s-video[-2]##also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ). 
[t] pretty good . 
##ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know . 
player[+2][p]##i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box . 
auto fit[+2]##i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal . 
##lot 's of other features that i need to find out about . 
look[+2][u]##looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors . 
##things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off ! 
remote[-3]##and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! 
[t] plays pancakes . 
play[+2][p]##this thing plays everything i feed it . 
##compusa , memorex , fuji . 
##plays them all . 
##i ordered 2 . 
[t] great dvd player . 
##i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself . 
format[+2][u]##when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with . 
use[+2], size[+2],look[+2]##easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot . 
##very happy ! 
[t] customer service is non-existent ! ! 
##i wish i could give negative stars ! 
##i bought this dvd player in november . 
##i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today . 
##i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one . 
##what a mistake ! 
player[-3][p]##after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty . 
##i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing . 
no disc[-2]##i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc . 
##i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens . 
customer service[-3][u]##i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable . 
customer service[-3][u]##i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered . 
##i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy . 
##that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make . 
##do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money ! 
[t] keep shopping , do n't stop here . 
##i bought this as a gift for my sister . 
player[-3][p]##it has never worked . 
player[-3]##i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine . 
##i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase . 
[t] worst customer service on record . 
player[-3][u]##purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it . 
on/off button[-2]##the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button . 
##the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever . 
##i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again . 
##i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem . 
customer service[-3][u]##they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . 
customer service[-3]##i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . 
##i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you . 
##once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message . 
##still no response . 
##i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb . 
[t] good price , bad product . 
##i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife . 
player[-3]##3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze . 
player[-2]##now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . 
customer service[-3][u]##have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid . 
customer service[-3][u]##have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through . 
player[-3][u],customer service[-3]##this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks . 
##i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba . 
[t] stay away from it . 
##i bought this product from amazon . 
play[-3]##after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd . 
picture[-2]##i can only hear the sound but no picture ! 
customer service[-3]##their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor . 
##no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me . 
[t] problems . 
##i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price . 
##however , i should have followed my instincts : 
##you get what you pay for . 
dvd[-3]##one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing . 
dvd[-3]##some dvd 's i rented would not play . 
##now , i suddenly have no picture . 
##i will say this . 
player[-2]##when the player was working it was great ,but . 
[t] the second apex - at least it 's prettier than the last . 
##the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated . 
##the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed : 
##i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks . 
##i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ). 
##back to the 2600 : 
##1 . 
smell[+1]##it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . 
##2 . 
look[+2]##without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 
##3 . 
picture quality[+3]##excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . 
##4 . 
remote[+2]##remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . 
##anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product . 
##i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one : 
##with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest . 
[t] does not play dvds with extra features .. . 
dvd[-2]##first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . 
player[+2]##unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . 
design[+2],player[+2]##as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . 
dvd[-2]##what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds . 
read[-2]##for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it . 
read[-2], dvd[-2]##at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well . 
player[+1]##this player seems to work fine with everything else . 
 
player[-2][u]##because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product . 
 
run[+2], dvd[+2]##it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 

run[+3], dvd media[+2]#apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) . 
dvd player[+3]##i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price . 

apex[+2]##most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . 

player[+2][p]##this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve . 
sound[+3],picture clarity[+3]##i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! 
case[+2],price[+2][u]##so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! 

picture[-3][u]##after two weeks the picture kept freezing . 

apex[-3]##apex sucks ! 

 
size[+1],machine[+2]##it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up . 
usage[+1]##basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used . 
player[+2][p]##so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine . 
picture[+2],sound[+2]##the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good . 

read[-2], disc[-2]##the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that . 

player[+1][p]##it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . 
##but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking . 
player[+1]##i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation . 
player[+2][p]##there are a lot of things i like about it . 
 
picture[+2]##received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector . 
remote[-1]##the remote is a little hard to understand . 
jpeg picture[-1]##my jpeg pictures are viewable on my 27 screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 monitor . 
dvd[+1]##so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read . 

video output[-3]##video output stopped workin . 
video output[-3]##this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) . 

player[-3][u]##what a disappointment ! 


set up[+1],player[-2]##set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week . 
lip-sync[-1]##there was occasionally a lip-sync issue. 
video[-2]##but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working . 
amazon[+3]##amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping . 

feature[+2],reliability[-2]##great feature list , poor reliability . 
output[-2]##output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold . 

display[+1]##retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display . 


unit[+3], format[+2]##the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " ! 

remote[-1]##p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? 

player[-3][u]##what the hell is wrong with this thing . 

play[-2], dvd[-2]##forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds. 
[t] only lasted a month ! 
##i bought the 2600 because it plays everything ! 
video output[-3]##well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) . 
video output[-3[p][u]##so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! 
[t] a frustrating christmas . 
##we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well . 
player[-3][p]##the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least . 
##the second one is up and running . 
player[+1][p]##it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much . 
##i am returning the broken one today . 
##i will not be ordering another one to replace it . 
player[-3]##update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! 
[t] disappointing - get what you pay for . 
look[+2],feature[+2]##the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling . 
dvd[-3]##i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds . 
##after " loading " for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated " no disk " . 
video[-2]##after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available . 
disk[-2]##only one disk played through to completion successfully . 
##at $ 49 . 
##i guess you get what you pay for . 
##i 'd recommend against this unit . 
[t] this dvd player ruined christmas - twice ! 
##i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts . 
player[-3][p], motor[-2], disc[-2]##when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door . 
##strike 1 .
player[-3]##when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either ! 
apex[-3]##imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex . 
power supply[-2]##the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on . 
##do not recommend . 
[t] let the countdown begin apex . 
##what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies . 
##in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 . 
##and have returned both . 
ad-1600[-3], ad-1220[-2]##the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up . 
##my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 . 
##i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them . 
##it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season . 
amazon[+3]##amazon is awaesome ! 
##they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back . 
##what more could you ask for . 
[t] price vs performance . 
dvd player[+2]##for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player . 
door[-1]##the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile . 
format[+3]##it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice . 
dvd[+1]##and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play . 
##recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony . 
[t] my first dvd player and i 'm well satisfied ! 
##i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player . 
##i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly . 
feature[+1]##i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there . 
size[+2],weight[+2]##the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand . 
player[+3][u]##i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy . 
##i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine . 
##even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal . 
[t] when it works , it 's great , when it does n't it 's frustrating . 
##bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 . 
##that was a mistake . 
dvd[-2]##we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason . 
##cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck . 
##i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the " finding nemo " dvd works fine . 
##i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for . 
player[-2]##i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good . 
player[-2]##only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon . 
[t] i will give it one more try ! 
##i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night . 
##i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc . 
player[-2], no disc[-2]##the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! 
##it worked . 
##i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc . 
##the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another . 
##the other company is currently " out of stock " so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today . 
##hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine . 
##if not i will avoid apex products in the future . 
player[+2]##besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! 
play[+3][u]##it plays everything , even vcd 's . 
##if only it played stand alone avi files . 
##if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating . 
##if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating . 
[t] well worth the money . 
player[+3][p]##i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of . 
player[+3][p]##but for what i do use it is perfect . 
##i was , however . 
##somewhat disappointed that i could not " hook up " to my sony multi brand remote commander . 
##small problem . 
[t] apex and remote control . 
##hi , many people are saying , " you get what you pay for , i guess . " 
##well that is not true . 
##you could have paid more and got a lot less . 
##i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 ! 
##you have to ask yourself , " how much money is dissapointment worth ? " 
##because , you will be dissapointed . 
##then you can say , " my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . " 
##i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment ! 
##so , without further adoo . 
freeze[-2], player[-2]##1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! " 
remote[-2]##2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong . 
##3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken . 
##4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something ! 
universal remote control[-2]##5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control . 
##i dare you to surf the net and find the code . 
##you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work . 
code[-2]##finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 . 
##and then you will start to belive them . 
##if this is your fist dvd player . 
##save yourself some aggrivation . 
[t] keep your receipt . 
##bought two ad2600 's for christmas . 
player[-2]##one still works fine , the other quit after one day . 
manual[+1]##owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide . 
customer service[-2][u]##apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone . 
[t] isacc l. fisher was wrong . 
player[+2]##the dvd player is fine . 
##to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press " menu " on the remote while the dvd is playing . 
##if the dvd is stopped , it will display " playback only " . 
##little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ . 
[t] fantastic dvd player for the price . 
##i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old . 
player[+3][p]##of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents . 
picture[+3]##the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv . 
loading[-2][u]##it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait . 
##also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short . 
player[+3]##but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there . 

picture[-3]##when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! 

dvd[-3],cd[-3], no disc[-2]##seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " . 

dvd player[-3]##granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player . 
menu[-2]##first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds . 
 
remote[-3]##the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use . 
remote[-1]##in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it . 
dvd[+2]##the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . 


dvd[-2]##it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches . 
dvd[-2]##both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going . 
speed[-3]##one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu . 
 
door[-2]##the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed . 
size[+1]##there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote . 
player[-2]##all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift . 

player[-3]##i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died . 

player[+1]##i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category . 
 
noise[-1], external display[-2]##there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open, and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance . 
look[+2],feature[+2]##still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! 

freeze[-2]##i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! 

player[-3][p]##i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work ! 

dvd[-3], read[-2]##unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way . 
support[-3]##i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing . 

dvd player[+3]##this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it . 


look[+2]##good looks 
 
quality[-3]##the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 
##2 . 
remote button[-2]##remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons . 

player[+2]##this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player . 

apex[+3]##apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players . 
 
 
dvd disc[-3], read[-3]##the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc . 
read[+2], cd audio disc[+2]##it will read and play all cd audio disc . 
 
amazon[+3]##i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far . 

quality[-2]##however, it has failed to deliver on quality . 
jpeg[-2],dvd[-2]##it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies . 
no disc[-2]##on several different occasions it has displayed no disc with a disc inside . 

apex[-1]##i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product . 

silver plate[-2]##the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . 

play[+2], cd[+2], mp3[+2], jpeg[+2]##it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs . 
play[-2], windows media[-2], divx rip[-2]##however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips . 

player[+2]##also,it was only $ 39.99 with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player . 
video quality[+2]##good video quality . 


read[-2], dvd[-2], vcd[-2]##cannot say whether i recorded an updated model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me . 
play[+2], dvd-r[+2]##it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine . 

price[+2]##mixed bag i guess but the price was right . 

price[+3]##this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price . 

build quality[+2],picture[+2],sound[+2]##the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch. 

look[+3][u]##it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims . 
format[+1]##i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did . 
product[+3]##i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have not had any problems . 
direction[+3]##there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc . 
dvd player[+2]##so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! 

weight[+1]##noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah . 
work[+3]##works great ! 
color[+2]##silverish color really adds a special touch . 
 
format[+2]##it plays just about any format. 

price[+2]##either way, cannot go wrong with this price . 

dvd player[+3]##i am really impressed by this dvd player . 
 
play[+2], dvd[+2]##for instance , i made several backups of my dvd movies using dvd-r  and + r and it plays the dvds . 
format[+3]##no matter the format .
